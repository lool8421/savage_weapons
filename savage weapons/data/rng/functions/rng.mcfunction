# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Run "/scoreboard players set min rng <minimum number>" to set a minimum number
# 2. Run "/scoreboard players set max rng <maximum number>" to set a maximum number
# 3. Run "/function <your_pack_name>:rng" to generate the number
# 4. Your ranom number between the given minimum and maximum is now stored as "out" in "rng"
# (Get it with "/scoreboard players operation <PLAYER> <SCOREBOARD> = out rng")
#
# *You don't need to set the minimum and maximum every time, it'll use the last used
# or the base which is min 0, max 100


# Activate the pack
